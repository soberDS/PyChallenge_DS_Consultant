Question 1:
*** Please don't use numpy or other lib first *** 
*** If you use too much time, use numpy and/or scipy ***

Haha, we always start to create a function do such thing, zzz...
     
Give a random muti-dimention list(or so-called n-by-m matrix), 
and A(can be any given number), 
[
  [A, 5, 3, 4, 9],
  [8, A, 1, 3, 2],
  [4, 5, A, 7, 10],
  [8, 2, 4, A, 13],
  [7, 4, 1, 2, 11],
]

To extract hidden pattern  [[ A,      rand_number],
                            [number,       A      ]]        
By couting how many of them occured and finding the index-positions. 
The hidden pattern matrix can be any size,but you can start with 2-by-2 matrix
